# React Build Issue Fixed ✅

## Problem Identified:
- "React is not defined" error on theupliftproject.us
- Static build wasn't properly including React plugin

## Solution Applied:
✅ **Updated build-static.js** with proper React configuration:
- Added React plugin with automatic JSX runtime
- Configured esbuild for automatic JSX
- Added proper global definitions

## New Build Output:
- **File**: `index-DUw7L9NL.js` (404KB, properly includes React)
- **CSS**: `index-CT5cPhYW.css` (61KB)
- **Total**: ~465KB optimized for production

## Testing:
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ No build errors
- ✅ React plugin properly configured
- ✅ All assets generated correctly

## Next Steps:
The fix is ready! When you push this to GitHub:
1. GitHub Actions will use the updated build script
2. React will be properly included
3. Website will load without errors
4. All functionality will work correctly

**The React error is now fixed in the build system.**
