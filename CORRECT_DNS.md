# Correct DNS Configuration for theupliftproject.us

## Your GitHub Username: thevirus-limiter ✅

Since you deleted the CNAME, add it back with the correct configuration:

### Required DNS Records:

**A Records (Keep these - they're correct):**
```
Type: A, Host: @, Value: 185.199.108.153, TTL: Automatic
Type: A, Host: @, Value: 185.199.109.153, TTL: Automatic  
Type: A, Host: @, Value: 185.199.110.153, TTL: Automatic
Type: A, Host: @, Value: 185.199.111.153, TTL: Automatic
```

**CNAME Record (Add this back):**
```
Type: CNAME, Host: www, Value: thevirus-limiter.github.io, TTL: Automatic
```

## GitHub Repository Setup:

1. **Repository name should be:** `theupliftproject` (or any name you prefer)
2. **Go to Settings → Pages:**
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "gh-pages" 
   - Custom domain: `theupliftproject.us`
   - ✅ Check "Enforce HTTPS"

## After DNS propagation (5-10 minutes):
- ✅ theupliftproject.us will work
- ✅ www.theupliftproject.us will work
- ✅ Both will redirect to HTTPS
- ✅ DNS check will pass

The original CNAME was correct - you just need to add it back and ensure your GitHub Pages is configured properly.
